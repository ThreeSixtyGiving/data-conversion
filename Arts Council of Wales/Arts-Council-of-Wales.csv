2005 is the centenary of the opening of the Coliseum as a theatre (now home to Ceredigion Museum) and this application is twofold -

1. To help fund a program of performances on the original stage and
2. To support our normal program of exhibitions in the gallery.

As will be seen from the enclosed list of events we are being very ambitious but expect that most of the events will be self-funding or sponsored by various organisations. Therefore we are only asking for funding for two groups, Jez Danks (music-based celebratory performance) and the Centre for Performance Research ('The Banquet' - experimental theatre performance).  We are asking for funding for 3 exhibitions (work by Chris Kinsey, Lynne Bebb and Karen Pearce) and in view of the many demands on the money available, we are asking for the bare minimum ie. artists' exhibiting fees, one-way transportation and where appropriate, hire fees.

The venue is developing partnership working with Theatr Gwynedd. Additional programming proposed for Theatr Gwynedd is: the staging of four major drama productions (Wuthering Heights, Twelfth Night, Macbeth and one other, plus two international dance productions Nats Nus Dance Company (Spain) and Renegade Dance Company (Germany). For Galeri it is: The staging of two dance productions by Urban Crew Dance and a series of six music recitals such as Llyr Williams / European Union Chamber Orchestra (Mozart Programme)  / Felicity Lott and Eugene Asti recital. This application should also allow for a much stronger partnership and the establishment of a joint marketing strategy as well as increased audiences for both venues. 

In Year 2, Theatr Gwynedd wish to develop into production by co-working with Welsh language companies such as Theatr Bara Caws, Llwyfan Gogledd Cymru and Cwmni'r Fran Wen and other English language companies such as Torch and the Sherman for summer productions. They also hope to increase the frequency of productions by international companies in co-operation with Creu Cymru.

Wales Theatre Company: The Grand Theatre has, over the past two years, worked successfully with Michael Bogdanov's Wales Theatre Company on three major, main stage, large scale works - 'Under Milk Wood', A Shakespeare Trilogy and a new Musical  'Amazing Grace'. The company is based at the Grand Theatre and usually rehearses its various productions there. An allocation will be put towards this continuing work/partnership.
Swansea's Ballet Russe: The small (14 strong) Ballet Russe based at the Grand Theatre for the past four years, continues to take quality classical ballet to all parts of Wales (and England), increasing its repertoire and number of performances year on year as well as giving up to four main house and six studio space performances at the Grand Theatre itself. Some funding will be used to further develop audiences for Ballet Russe - and dance in general - at our venue.
Clwyd Theatr Cymru: Clwyd Theatre Cymru has not presented work at Swansea Grand Theatre for over 10 years. The venue is very keen to remedy this.
Programming of studio space: Much has already been done in relation to introducing a programme of events and exhibitions into the Theatre Arts Wing, but we are keen to link, more often, with other presenters in Wales in order to provide an even greater programme of activity in this fast developing area of our theatre's operation. It is hoped that outreach work, and specific target marketing initiatives will play a crucial part in further developing an audience for the Arts Wing presentations and that, in so doing, the venue as a whole will be appealing to an ever widening audience.
Key partners in the proposals: will include the Wales Theatre Company, Clwyd Theatr Cymru, Swansea Ballet Russe, The Torch Theatre, Milford Haven, and the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff.

1.	To build up and sustain a core audience for quality professional drama. This includes English and Welsh Language companies. Ideally, work that has originated in Wales would always take a priority, but the programme is keen to also include work of international companies.
2.	To encourage participation in all levels - acting, writing, stage management, directing in the form of an active youth group.

It works across Wales supporting writers working in English and Welsh, and also manages a series of grant schemes on behalf of ACW, as well as the Book of the Year, a presence at Hay Festival and delivery of ACW's Literature Action Plan. They are based in Cardiff Bay and manage the Glyn Jones Centre at WMC.

The Writers on Tour scheme helps finance visits by practising writers to schools, libraries, pubs, clubs, societies, community centres, arts festivals and other venues throughout Wales. It is Britain's oldest and most straightforward funding scheme for literature events.

The Writer's Residencies scheme helps fund sustained periods of work by one or more writers in a single location or on a single project. These may run at schools in a cluster group, at youth clubs or libraries, at a group of day centres or old people's homes, etc.  The Writer's Residencies scheme enables organisers to plan more intensive programmes to connect writers with community groups of all kinds.  The opportunity is usually given for participants to have sustained contact with a writer or writers across a period of time.

The Programme Support Scheme offers financial assistance to literature organisers involved with venue, festival or series programming. It is aimed at venue managers concerned to establish long term regular literature slots in their schedule; at festival organisers; at activists running literary tours; and at other literary entrepreneurs concerned to promote literary events on a larger or wider scale than the normal pattern for events supported by the Academi's Writers On Tour scheme.

The Development Services for Writers scheme offers two services to writers in Wales:

i) 	Writers' Critical Service: 
Providing assessments of writers' work to help them develop their skills.  A small fee is payable.
ii) 	Mentoring: 
Providing advice and assistance to promising authors to help develop their work to a publishable standard. 

Writer's Bursaries  are awarded to support writers creating new work in the following genres: novels, short stories, poetry, literary criticism and factual prose of literary merit.  Writing which does not fit neatly into these categories can also be considered. Plays are not eligible under this service. Bursaries will not be awarded to assist work on a thesis or any other piece of formal academic research.

We have made comprehensive changes to our website, which is now fully bi-lingual in a direct attempt to reach sectors of the Welsh speaking community. 
We are dedicating the Friday night Bluegrass Concert in th Civic Hall to the recently opened Ty Gobaith Cymru Children's Hospice, near Rowen. There will be an exit collection for the hospice, and 40 tickets for the Friday night and 40 tickets from Saturday night will be available to Ty Gobaith Cymru to raffle as prizes for any auction of promises or fund raising activity as Ty Gobaith Cymru sees as appropriate, or to pass on to the local staff. We will be featuring their logo on all relevant literature, programmes, fliers and on backdrops to the Civic Hall and marquee stages. This is to encourage as many local people to recognise the strong links between Conwy and the Bluegrass Festival, now in its 17th year.
To further encourage local people in particular to enjoy the expanded free elements of the Festival programme, the open square in Conwy will be utilised for extra Appalachian clogging demonstrations. Feedback from Conwy business people and Conwy Town Council endorses the higher profile of the Festival with residents. The usual full programme of structured events also continues. 
With other members of the local music community, we have recently established a monthly Bluegrass Music Club in the Malt Loaf in Conwy, again with a view to encourage anyone interested in the - music to come along and participate. The Bluegrass Clubs in Abergele, Halkyn and Llanelian, mentioned in previous applications are all thriving. There is doubtless a special affinity with Bluegrass and old time music within Wales, from where many tunes, ballads and folksongs were taken during the migrations by miners from Wales to America in the 1700s and 1800s.

Sculpture by the Sea workshops were set up in 2003 as a follow-on from Swansea's very successful Environmental Green Art project in 2002 funded by ACW, when 45 primary schools in the area took part in a 2-day workshop with artists in a woodland setting to make temporary public art. The project was hailed a great success and the 3 main artists involved collaborated to design further environmental art workshops for children in a different location.  The artists are: Sara Holden, Dave Marchant and Tina Marie Cunningham.

The project develops our workshops further into a festival that will link the community of Swansea with Europe in an artistic and environmental way. Called Sculpture by the Sea Festival/Cerflun ar Ian y Mor Gwyl, it will feature a site specific sculpture trail and interconnecting workshops on the foreshore of Swansea Bay. Its purposes will be to celebrate the art of sculpture, bringing it into the community with opportunities for all to participate, and to strengthen cultural links with the three twinned towns of Mumbles in Wales, Kinsale in Ireland and Hennebont in France. The festival will involve artists from these towns who will create site-specific environmental sculpture for the trail beside the footpath between Singleton and Blackpill.

After the Festival, an exhibition will be created and shown in 4 different locations: The Environment Centre and Mumbles Library, Swansea, and then on to venues in Cork and Hennebont during September 2005.

These are:
Contemporary dance, Jazz, Children/Young people's theatre, Drama, International Work - all disciplines.

1.  Enhancing the ""bought in"" programme, by for example:
·	Increasing the run for Drama
·	Presenting exciting high profile companies previously outside our budget.
·	Taking more risks with new/less well known companies/productions
2.  Taking a strategic role as producer/ co-producer of new work and in particular:
·	Co-producing/facilitating touring into Wales by international companies
·	Create opportunities for children & young people to make dance & appreciate dance
·	Developing the Dance Days festival
·	Co-producing middle scale, mainstream, high quality drama
·	Be a facilitator for other new collaborative initiatives.
Dance: We have excellent relationship with Diversions. We have undertaken two joint recce visits in the past 12 months and have worked together to bring Toni Mira's Solos show ""Loft"" to Cardiff and Swansea in June 2005. We are in discussion regarding a co-production role in touring the new Nats Nus production to Wales in early spring 2006. We intend to co-produce further international tours in partnership with Diversions in 2007 and 2008. Taliesin has already taken the lead in asking Creu Cymru to facilitate a Wales Dance Consortium. Locally we are working with the Grand Theatre on complementing and supporting our respective dance programmes. Taliesin's new initiative, ""Swansea A City that Dances"", is a concrete manifestation of our commitment to work in partnership - locally and internationally, celebrate and develop artists and the art form, and to build new audiences.
Theatre: We are concerned at the continuing and severe dearth of English Language mainstream theatre produced in Wales for the middle scale & the impact on our programme and audiences. We are in discussion with the Wales Theatre Company and with Torch Theatre.
Music: We will continue to build on or excellent relationship with Swansea Festival to present large/r scale jazz and world music events to Swansea to enhance the festival offer.

The start of the 21st century has seen a remarkable renewal of interest in Welsh classical music and particularly so in areas that connect with a larger potential audience. Two figures central to this development are th composers Karl Jenkins OBE and the first Royal Harpist Catrin Finch. This project seeks to build further connections between these two outstanding welsh artists whose partnership will be embodied in the new Requiem by Karl Jenkins which is being recorded by EMI Records in Jan 2005 prior to its public world premiere in London. The WCO has exclusive rights to the touring of this work in Wales and therefore to its Welsh premiere. In broadening its performance base to a number of major Welsh churches covering the length and breadth of the Principality the WCO aims to attract an entirely new audience to a particular brand of classical Welsh music. 

We will also be working alongside The Prince of Wales Arts and Kids Foundation to provide access to the widest range of young people of all ages and backgrounds. Each area has been chosen specially in order to build upon choirs of cathedral children and associated church groups and the aim is to introduce choral and religious music to as many of their friends as possible. WCO will also collaborate and will also link this provision with the Archbishop of Wales's Award for Church Music that has connections with all the major church venues in Wales. To this end a dedicated programme of school concerts has been planned to support the public performances. The choral music in particular has an accessibility that will appeal to young audiences who might otherwise not respond to church music. The aim is to attract families and the sense of community as a whole that is an essential part of the fabric of choral and orchestral societies.

Key Development 1 - To allow Theatr Brycheiniog to develop its audiences and increase attendances by presenting a wider range of quality presentations and performances that were previously unaffordable.  Highlights of the programme will include:
·	more split-week drama touring by companies such as Northern Broadsides, Clwyd Theatr Cymru, Compass and Sherman Theatre.
·	to continue the dance development programme in association with Diversions Dance presenting both UK based and international companies such as Richard Alston Dance, Wayne McGgregor, Siobhan Davies, Ballet Boyz, Rumble and the Scottish Dance Theatre
·	build on the success of the classical music and opera programme by including companies such as Britten Sinfonia, Music Theatre Wales, Katherine Jenkins and the National Chamber Orchestra of Wales, Opera Cocktail and Tallis Scholars. 
Key Development 2 - To develop a production element to add a new dimension to programming.  The Theatre has been involved in commissioning original work previously with Diversions, Welsh Independent Dance, Theatr y Byd, Volcano and Steel Wasps.  Brycheiniog will look to invest in productions over the next three years and has already established dialogue with Theatr na Nog, Earthfall and Music Theatre Wales.
Key Development 3 - Theatr Brycheiniog has a close working relationship with the Brecon Jazz Festival and hopes to establish Brycheiniog/Brecon Jazz as the key year round organisation for the promotion of jazz in Wales.  Along with presenting more jazz in the programme, Brycheiniog will also work with Serious, the UK's leading jazz agency/promoter to present more jazz concerts throughout Wales.  Accompanying programme development, the theatre also aims to increase its highly successful outreach/education work in relation to jazz.

q	developing the quality and scale of presentation and programming
q	prioritising those artforms which already have a proven track record at the venue - music (world, traditional, roots, classical), music theatre and drama
q	using the programme enhancement to further drive forward audience development
q	the full development and realisation of the creative potential that exists in the partnership between the theatre and the newly created media centre
q	to contribute fully to the strategic development of the presenting/producing venue network by working closely with Creu Cymru, ACW and other presenting venues
Presentation Programme - As stated above, the programme will focus on artform development (music, music theatre and drama) and highlights will include: Bellowhead, Clwyd Theatr Cymru, Le Vent du Nord, Tara Arts, Danu (Irish traditional music band) and the Eduardo Niebla Experience (Spanish guitarist). The programme enforces the venue's commitment to the promotion of international as well as UK based work.
Production Programme - Some of the most exciting developments will take place in collaboration between the venue and companies on joint production projects.  Again, a concentration will be upon music, music theatre and drama and will see Mwldan working on productions with:
·	Opera Cocktail - on two music theatre co-productions to tour to other Welsh venues and further afield.
·	Yair Dalal - leading Israeli musicians and dancers.  This will take forward and develop international world music at Mwldan and other Welsh venues.
·	Eugenio Bennato and Taranta Power - a tour of musicians and dancers from Naples to six Welsh venues.
·	Cegin Ceri - sessions based on Welsh traditional music curated, developed and presented by Ceri Rhys Matthews a leading Welsh traditional musician and producer.
·	Mappa Mundi - a new touring production of ""Canterbury Tales"" with a pre-production period based at Theatr Mwldan and touring to venues across Wales and England. 
Outcomes: The projects for Presention and Production/Presentation for Year 1 alone are estimated to produce a total of 97 performances during the lifetime of the projects.

'Once upon a time an Englishman met a Welshman in a field...he was there to tell him the right time.'

It is hard for us to imagine these days that in Victorian times, Britain has a difference in time of half an hour from the eastern and western extremities. The play begins with the arrival of an Englishman representing Brunel: he comes to tell the Welsh that due to railway expansion, time needs to be standardized. Pater's comedy tells of the consequences over the next 180 years.

The devotion to this art by the tutors as well as the social and cultural element that this brings with it will be its starting point. The composer will react to the traditional cerdd dant in collaboration with a visual artist, with the music being a mixture of the traditional factor of the craft as well as experimental techniques and more contemporary augmentations.

Ffotogallery’s contribution to photographic and new media cultures is primarily through major exhibitions, supported by an impressive publication programme, significant commissions and themed conferences. Central to this is an engagement with progressive and uncompromising critical debate, aligned closely with art practice that has involved meaningful partnerships with institutions and peers across the cultural sector. As a Beacon Company we would be empowered to consolidate these four key drivers further, with particular emphasis on extending the publishing portfolio for artists in Wales and providing a number of Wales-based commissions to further add to the country’s iconographic richness. We envisage developing a suite of branded monographs that would feature key practitioners in Wales, whose work would be contextualised by new writing and criticism. Similarly we would wish to engage a number of artists from Wales and internationally and commission them to respond to the varied and evolving cultural landscape of Wales.

Ffotogallery’s contribution to photographic and new media cultures is primarily through major exhibitions, supported by an impressive publication programme, significant commissions and themed conferences. Central to this is an engagement with progressive and uncompromising critical debate, aligned closely with art practice that has involved meaningful partnerships with institutions and peers across the cultural sector. As a Beacon Company we would be empowered to consolidate these four key drivers further, with particular emphasis on extending the publishing portfolio for artists in Wales and providing a number of Wales-based commissions to further add to the country’s iconographic richness. We envisage developing a suite of branded monographs that would feature key practitioners in Wales, whose work would be contextualised by new writing and criticism. Similarly we would wish to engage a number of artists from Wales and internationally and commission them to respond to the varied and evolving cultural landscape of Wales.
