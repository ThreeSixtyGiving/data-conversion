Additional Notes
-----------------------

Inconsistent use of Identifier in source data
*********************************************
Data presented at source (http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/grants-arts/awards-made-area-and-artform/) lacks a consistent use of the column Ref No, which is in turn used for the grant Identifier.  In the current live data, only the 2013-14 dataset publishes this column - it is in sporadic use in the monthly datasets.  Hence, only 2013-14 has been transformed and published.  
See Issue:

No Recipient Org:Identifier
*********************************************
This has not yet been added to the data.
See Issue:

Regional / Local Authority Names not mapped
*********************************************
Some work is needed to mint region and local authority references
See Issue: 

Main art form / Classifications
*********************************************
Extra work needed to transform "Main art form" into structured Classification
See Issue:
